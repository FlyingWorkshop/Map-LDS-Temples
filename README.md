# IMPORTANT: main.py will NOT work unless you have a folder (can be empty) called 'Leaves' in the same directory. You must also add your own Google API key.

# IMPORTANT: To update 'root.json' or 'Any Given Temple.json' in Leaves, you must delete the file manually. The next time main.py is run, the files will be recreated.
